## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ash44444/billeasyassessment.git
cd billeasyassessment

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Configure environment variables

Create a .env file in the root folder with:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/book-review-db
JWT_SECRET=yourStrongJWTSecretHere

4. Run the development server

npm run dev

The server will start at: http://localhost:5000
üöÄ How to Run Locally

    Make sure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud MongoDB URI.

    Use tools like Postman or curl for API testing.

    Securely keep your .env file and never commit secrets to GitHub.

üß† Design Decisions & Assumptions

    Authentication: JWT used for stateless, secure user sessions.

    Password Security: Passwords hashed with bcrypt before storing.

    One Review Per User Per Book: Enforced using a unique compound index on (userId, bookId).

    Pagination: Supported for books and reviews to handle large datasets efficiently.

    Search: Case-insensitive partial matching on book title and author using MongoDB regex queries.

    Average Rating: Computed dynamically using aggregation when fetching book details.

    Data Validation: Basic validation done in controllers for required fields and data types.

    Modular Architecture: Code separated into controllers, models, routes, and middleware for maintainability and scalability.

    Security: Helmet and CORS enabled (if included in your project), and environment variables used for secrets.

    Assumption: User roles are not implemented (all authenticated users have equal permissions for this basic project).

    Error Handling: Basic error handling middleware included for clarity and clean responses.

Unique compound index on (userId, bookId) prevents duplicate reviews.
üß™ Advanced Postman Testing Tips

    Environment Variables: Define {{baseUrl}} (e.g., http://localhost:5000) and {{jwtToken}} in Postman environment.

    Use Pre-request scripts to automatically refresh tokens if implementing refresh flow.

    Use Tests tab in Postman to assert status codes, response structure, and extract tokens for chaining requests.

    Use Collection Runner to run bulk tests with data files (CSV/JSON) for load and bulk testing.

    Save requests with descriptions and example responses for team collaboration.
